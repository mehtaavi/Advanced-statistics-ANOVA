GolfBall Problem Statement using ANOVA


Sporting  goods  manufacturing  company  wanted  to  compare  the distance travelled by golf balls produced using four different designs.  Ten balls were manufactured with each design and were brought to thelocal golf course for the  club  professional  to  test.  The  order  in  which  the balls  were  hit  with  the same  club  from  the  first  tee  was  randomized  sothat  the  pro  did  not  know which type of ball was being hit. All 40 balls were hit in a short period of time, during  which  the  environmentalconditions  were  essentially  the  same.  The results   (distance   travelled   inyards)   for   the   four   Designs   are   stored inGolfball.csvAt the 0.05 level of significance, is there evidence of a difference in themean distances travelled by the golf balls with differentdesigns?
